**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/GameDev/Creator)`**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Arthur Barilli da Silva, a passionate game developer and software developer in training. With a bachelor's degree in Game Design and over three years of experience creating dynamic and engaging gaming experiences, I've worked on various projects, including 3D/2D platformers, beat'em ups, hack'n slash, and puzzle games.
ðŸŒŸ I thrive on learning and pushing boundaries, continuously refining my skills through game jams and personal projects. I recently expanded my expertise by diving into **System Developing and Analisis**, focusing on developing robust systems and exploring mobile game development.
Some of my work can be found on my Itch.io page which is right [here ](https://barilli.itch.io)
